## Cursed Life

This is a basic exercise in the Curses Python module, implementing Conway's Game of Life in a console display format.

Currently includes functions to draw a random grid of active cells, and a drawGlider function with 4 direction options!

Command line arguments:

    --glider -g: places some gliders in hard coded positions
    --random -r [float]: initializes the grid with [float] proportion of cells randomly active
    --speed -s [int]: sets refresh rate to [int]ms (default 75ms)
